## 🎯 Priority Features

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Week 1-2)

#### 1. Chat Enhancements UI (8-12 hours)
**Status**: Models Complete ✅ | UI Implementation Needed

**What's Already Done:**
- ✅ All data models created
- ✅ Database schema ready
- ✅ Widget components created:
  - `MessageReactionBar` - Reaction display
  - `ReactionPicker` - Emoji selector

```

**Database:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE cycles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  group_id UUID REFERENCES village_groups(id),
  cycle_number INTEGER,
  start_date TIMESTAMP,
  end_date TIMESTAMP,
  status TEXT, -- active, closed, archived
  total_contributions DECIMAL,
  total_loans_disbursed DECIMAL,
  total_interest_earned DECIMAL,
  total_expenses DECIMAL,
  net_profit DECIMAL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
